# YOLOv11 Computer Vision Powered Search Application

##  Project Description — YOLOv11 Image Search
YOLOv11 Image Search is a Streamlit-based computer-vision search engine that lets you detect, index, and search images using object detection powered by YOLOv11m.
#### The app allows us to:
* Run object detection on a folder of images using yolo11m.pt model weights

* Generate metadata for each image (detected classes, bounding boxes, counts, confidence scores)

* Load previously saved metadata without re-running inference

##### Search images by:

* selecting one or more object classes (e.g., apple, bus, bicycle, etc.)

* choosing OR / AND search modes

* setting optional count thresholds

* View results in a responsive grid, with bounding box overlays and highlighted matches

* Export search results as JSON

This tool makes it easy to find images containing specific objects with precise filtering, and visualize them with clean UI elements.
